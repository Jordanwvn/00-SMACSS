##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

My decisions went like this: anything having to do with a class or id went into modules, as well as smaller rules. Anything having to do with sizing or positioning went into layout. Everything else, which was rules for text info on major parts of the page, went into base.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did not refactor any of the existing CSS. I didn't see anything necessarily pressing that I thought needed changing.
